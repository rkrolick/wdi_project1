### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__:

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Meets Expectations** From your commit history, it looks like you had a clear goal in mind when you started, and it appears you were able to break you days down into mostly accomplishable scope. One thing to keep in mind for a project this ambitious is that it would really help you to plan your bronze, silver, and gold MVPs. That way you can get each version to work, before moving on. As we start working on larger applications in the future, it would be nice to include more evidence of your planning process, such as wireframes, ERD's, a Trello board, etc.

* __Technical Requirements__:

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Exceeds Expectations** Not going to lie, was blown away by the scope of the problem you took on to solve, and the technical approach to an idea that had a lot of complexity. Definitely demonstrated dynamic proficiency in vanilla JS, and also incorporated in flexbox! Nice job using conventions we learned in class, such as using objects to encapsulate appropriate actor's data and behavior. Couple of tips moving forward, if you feel like you're reinventing the wheel, I would encourage you to look into additional libraries / plugins to help with cutting scope.

* __Code Quality__:

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Exceeds Expectations** Overall, code was well-structured and included great code comments. Please review my inline code comments [here](https://github.com/rkrolick/wdi_project1/compare/gh-pages...nolds9:feedback) (prefixed with my initials - "NHO") for feedback.

* __Problem Solving__:

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Exceeds Expectations** Excellent job getting a jumpstart on this project, and constantly challenging yourself to build upon your work. It's apparent you had a vision for what you wanted the game to look / play like, and you broke the problem down into programmable chunks. I really liked how you had fun with this, and would encourage you to continuing working on this, and even publish it, if only to `reddit.com/r/internetisbeautiful`

Keep up the great work, and you'll be hired in no time!

Also, wanted to provide some more resources to help you in your quest of perfectly collision detection:
  * an example of a WDI instructor's [game](https://github.com/harimohanraj89/asteroid) utilizing collision detection
  * a jQuery extension for [collision detection](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jquerycollision/)
  * an example from [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2440377/javascript-collision-detection)
